/**
 * This class is intended to be the base class for associating a resource by
 * using a "type" field as a way to differentiate between resources.
 *
 * For example: Fields are created globally for contacts or organizations. All
 * fields are stored in the same table but finding custom fields for a contact
 * is achieved by querying by the "type" column with "contact"
 *
 * Although similar, do not confuse this class with ResourceKeyAssociation
