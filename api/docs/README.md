## Development

For creating new classes following our Routes/Biz/DAO/Sequelize pattern, see the following:

1. [Sequelize README](./../lib/middlewares/sequelize/README.md)
2. [DAO README](./../lib/dao/README.md)
3. [Biz README](./../lib/biz/README.md)
4. [Routes README](./../lib/routes/README.md)
5. [Code Generators README](./../lib/generators/README.md)

You may want to keep #5 open as you read about steps 1-4 as code generation ties in all these concepts.
